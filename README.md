# SDAccel RTL Kernel Tutorial

This tutorial explains the procedure for creating a RTL Kernel using SDAccel Flow. 

The steps for creating an RTL Kernel are:
1. Summary of Design Overiew 
2. RTL Kernel Wizard.  
3. Integrating the DUT with the AXI, FIFO Interface.
4. Creating testbench. 

This tutorial uses the aes128 crypto core example from the opensource. 

## Downloading the design files 
Downlaod the design files from this link http://opencores.org/project,systemcaes  

# 1. Summary of Desing Overiew

## AES128 Encrypter and Decrpyter design overivew
   The first AES128 module takes in Data and Key as inputs and outputs a cipher, the second module uses the cypher from the first module and key from the testbench and decrypt the cypher to give back the original message.

## AES128 Encrypter and Decrpyter RTL KERNEL
   A kernel can be implemented in RTL and developed using the VivadoÂ® IDE tool suite. RTL kernels offer potentially higher performance with lower area and power but require development using RTL coding, tools, and verification methodologies. The tool generates the basic template of AXI Read/write, FIFO Interface for the user, the user has to add custom logic to talk to this interface.

# 2. RTL Kernel Wizard 		
   1. Execute the following commands on your local machine for starting a new SDaccel project:
```
    $ mkdir crypto_core
    $ cd crypto_core                                      
    $ cp -r ~/Downlaod ./
    $ sdx_171
``` 
    2. Once you open the SDAccel, navigate to the Xilinx option on the top left and select Create RTL Kernel.
